# NgAdvRefresher

## Introduction

This repository contains an exercise which you may do to practice some angular basics again. The main focus is on setting up a reactive architecture.

*hint: if you don't want to use [ngrx](https://ngrx.io/docs), you can also use flux pattern and store the values in subjects.*

### content of exercise

What will be done in this exercise?

1. basic setup of project including redux devtools
2. adding business functionality in app.component
3. adding state to the application
    1. root state
    2. business state
4. displaying state
5. creating specific selector for state
6. creating actions & reducer functions for state changes

If you have trouble during one step, you can cheat by taking a look at the specified backup branch 
(start with 0-start-setup, result of first step is 1-finished-ngrx-setup, and so on.)

*hint: provided solution in backup branch may not be the best possible solution*

If there are questions, you can contact one of your trainers or keep them for the training.

## 1. Basic Setup of ngrx

### Check out project
    
    git clone https://github.com/devonfw-ng-adv-training/refresher

### Start with initial branch

    git checkout 0-start-setup

### Install dependencies
    
    npm install 

### Add [@ngrx/store](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/install) &  [@ngrx/store-devtools](https://ngrx.io/guide/store-devtools/install) to project
    
    ng add @ngrx/store
    ng add @ngrx/store-devtools

### Install [Redux Devtools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) for your favorite browser
  
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools)
  - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
  - [Internet Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)

### Start the Application

    ng serve

### Confirm successful setup

Check out application state in the browser and confirm *@ngrx/state/init* in the dev tools

### Backup branch

backup branch exists [here](https://github.com/devonfw-ng-adv-training/refresher/tree/1-finished-ngrx-setup) and will be used in the next step

## 2. Exercice One: adding a counter to app.component

We will want to create a counter functionality to a otherwise empty application. The counter has the following requirements

- display current counter, initial value 0
- increment by +1, +10, +100
- decrement by -1, -10, -100
- reset counter to initial value

![functionalities](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13346973/84493043-6a3b2b80-aca7-11ea-9f2a-0dd667c6425f.gif "Exercise One: functionalities in action")

*Exercise One: functionalities in action*

Implement these functionalities to app.component and test the application.

## 3. Exercise Two: setting up a state for counter

As we want to have a reactive architecture, we store the counter state in our store. What do we have to do?

remember this slide?

![reactive-architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13346973/84515112-55bd5a00-accc-11ea-8b76-b560e8254a99.png "reactive architecture")

We will implement this step by step.

1. Store including State (Exercise Two, part 1 and 2)
2. View with Selectors (Exercises Three & Four)
3. Actions (Exercise Five)

## Part 1: setting up the root state

create root state (we call it `AppState` in this project)

- create file `index.ts` in `src/app/reducers`
- define & export application state (empty interface `AppState`)
- define & export root reducer (empty object of ActionReducerMap`<AppState`>)
- import root reducer in `StoreModule` in `app.module.ts`

Does your application still work? How does the state in Redux Devtools now look like?

### Backup branch

## Part 2: setting up the counter state

hint: for easier setup, you can install and use [@ngrx/schematics](https://ngrx.io/guide/schematics)
    
    ng add @ngrx/schematics

We now want to store the partial state `CounterState` in `AppState`. You can use schematics for this, or go step by step whatever is your preferred option.

### Doings

- *(optional) create a module for counter state*
- create file `counter.reducer.ts`
- define & export counter state
- define & export reducer functions
- add state & reducer to AppState & AppReducer


### solution with schematics

#### *(optional) add module*

      ng generate module counter --flat false

#### generate feature store via cli

      ng generate @ngrx/schematics:store counter/Counter -m counter.module.ts

#### in `src/app/counter/reducers/index.ts`

    - rename `State` to `CounterState` 
    - remove meta reducer
    - add initial state

          export const initialState: CounterState = {
            value: 0
          };

    - create reducer function

          const counterReducer = createReducer(
            initialState,
          );

          export function reducer(state: CounterState | undefined, action: Action) {
            return counterReducer(state, action);
          }

#### in `src/app/reducers/index.ts`

- add `CounterState` to `AppState`
- add `reducer` to `reducers`

#### verify result with redux devtools

fire up the application and check out if the value on Redux DevTools is correctly set to initial value of 0

### Backup branch

backup branch exists [here](https://github.com/devonfw-ng-adv-training/refresher/tree/4-exercise-three-wiring-up-the-counter) and will be used in the next step


## 4. Exercise Three: wiring up the counter to the state

We now want to use the counter state to display the value

For this we have the following doings:

### Doings

- create counter component
- extract business logic from app component to counter component
- use counter component in app component
- verify stable application
- inject `Store<AppState>` to counter component
- display `value` of `CounterState` in parallel to component value

### Backup branch

backup branch exists [here](https://github.com/devonfw-ng-adv-training/refresher/tree/5-exercise-four-using-selectors) and will be used in the next step

## 5. Exercise Four: using ngrx selectors

Up next we will create a [selector](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/selectors) for displaying the value. This has many advantages. One of them is information hiding, so we only get information which is relevant in the specific component. For us it's the value of counter.

### Doings

- create feature selector for `counter` via @ngrx/schematics
- create specific selector for `value` of `CounterState`
- use selector in `counter.component.ts`

### Backup branch

backup branch exists [here](https://github.com/devonfw-ng-adv-training/refresher/tree/6-exercise-five-using-actions-and-wiring-them) and will be used in the next step

## 6. Exercise Five: using ngrx actions

As a last step we want to be able to manipulate the data in the store. this is possible via actions which we dispatch.

### Doings

- create actions for 
    - incrementing
    - decrementing
    - resetting
- create reducer functions for all actions
- dispatch actions in counter component

*hint: use @ngrx/schematics where possible*

### Possible solution
